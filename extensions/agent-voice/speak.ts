/**
 * speak tool + playback manager.
 *
 * - Wraps ~/.local/bin/agent-say (local Kokoro TTS), non-blocking playback.
 * - Word budget enforced HERE (not in the prompt): hard cap truncates and
 *   saves the full text to a file the user can read.
 * - Stoppable: each announcement runs as its own process group; stopPlayback()
 *   kills ALL of them (python wrapper AND paplay child). WCAG 1.4.2.
 * - Diagnosable: every spawn's stderr is captured to a 0600 file; failed runs
 *   keep it and record a lastError surfaced by /voice status (clean runs and
 *   user-stopped runs clean up after themselves).
